title: 30-day Project - Auth0 User Roles.
---

## User roles

Integrating Auth0 into my app was...suspiciously simple.

But I need more than simple authentication — I need *authorization*, too. Based on the roles assigned to each particular user.

Now I'll see if I can really put Auth0 to work.

## Goals for the day

- Figure out how to assign — and extract — role information on authenticated users.
